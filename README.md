# characters

Just a few character helpers for Go

## Why

I've been in the situation where I had a need for all letters in the latin alphabet,
and always seem to google for the alphabet to make sure I remember all letters,
so I decided to make a simple package for this - and more, sorry!

I had a specific need for this again in [moths](https://github.com/Mobilpadde/moths),
and had it with searching to be sure ðŸ¤·
